            A Nevada bed is a simple but elegant wooden bed frame that comes in
            a range of options to suit you. This bed frame is especially good
            for kids because of its low height.

            Made from beautiful and timeless solid wood, our Nevada bed frame is

            The sprung slatted base of these beds is one of the key things that
            make them so comfortable. The sturdy centre legs ensure the bed
            remains firmly in place. Your choice of mattress will also affect
            how comfortable the bed is.

            <p>
              Regular beds can be very cumbersome, especially a king size bed
              frame. The slatted headboard and sturdy materials make Nevada beds
              an all-around popular choice.

                Sleigh beds

              space as their main criteria.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Nevada bed frame is a very low and streamlined design. Because
              of this, it’s ideal for rooms with minimal space or ceilings that
              are so low you’re worried about bumping your head!
            </p>
            <p>
              Some beds, such as Time Living beds, also have chrome corner feet
              but our Nevada beds don’t. They have solid wooden legs so there’s
              no chrome that may get scratched.

          <p className={css["divp"]}>
            Did you know, over a lifetime, the average person will spend over
            200,000 hours sleeping? That’s a lot of time to spend in bed, so
            choosing the right one for you is vital.
          </p>
          <p className={css["divp"]}>
            But how do you choose a new fabric bed frame? Below we’ve covered
            some essential factors to consider when buying your new bed.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h5 className={css["ph5"]}>Comfort</h5>
          <p className={css["divp"]}>
            If you’re comfortable, you’ll fall asleep faster and there’s nothing
            worse than being unable to sleep because your back hurts. When
            you’re feeling comfortable you’ll also stay asleep for longer.
          </p>
          <p className={css["divp"]}>
            Not only will you sleep for longer, but resting in comfort can help
            you stay in longer bursts of that restorative deep sleep. Why not
            visit one of our UK stores and try the many products that we offer?
          </p>
          <p className={css["divp"]}>
            As our customer reviews show, our fabric bed frames are top-quality
            and our friendly sales assistants are happy to help you choose your
            new bed.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h5 className={css["ph5"]}>Size</h5>
          <p className={css["divp"]}>
            Like the comfort levels, size is also important, so be sure to
            consider the size of your bedroom. If your room is fairly small, a
            double bed frame or a huge king size bed frame probably won’t be the
            ideal choice..
          </p>
          <p className={css["divp"]}>
            However, to relax and drift off to sleep properly you need to have
            sufficient space around the bed. If you have a sleeping partner,
            consider them as well.
          </p>
          <p className={css["divp"]}>
            If you have a large bedroom, then you can take full advantage of
            that space and go for a super king bed. This is especially true if
            you or your partner are taller than 6 feet, you don’t want to have
            any limbs hanging over the edge because your bed is too small!
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h5 className={css["ph5"]}>Storage</h5>
          <p className={css["divp"]}>
            Under-bed storage is another factor you should consider when
            searching for your new fabric bed frame. A bed base with built-in
            drawers provides convenience while still looking sophisticated,
            ideal for contemporary and modern homes.{" "}

              Yes, our Nevada beds are the perfect choice for kids due to their
