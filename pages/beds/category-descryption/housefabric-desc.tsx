        <h3>FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions)</h3>
        <strong>What is a linen fabric divan Bed?</strong>
        <p>
          When it comes to buying a new bed, a linen fabric divan bed is one of
          the best choices out there. These box-shaped beds are simple but
          incredibly practical. A divan bed set consists of a specially
          designed, firm base and a matching mattress. The sturdy frame is
          covered in fabric for an aesthetically pleasing appearance, and the
          bed is usually mounted on castor wheels, or you can choose chrome
          gliders if you have wood or laminate flooring.
        </p>
        <strong>Which mattress size is best suited to a Divan base?</strong>
        <p>
          This depends on which size base you choose. For example, if you have a
          king-size bed, you wouldn’t buy a single-size mattress, as it would be
          far too small. Another advantage to divans is that they don’t take up
          too much space, as the bed is only as wide as its mattress.
        </p>
        <strong>What size is a king-size divan base?</strong>
        <p>
          A standard king-size divan base and mattress are 5 feet wide and 6
          feet and 6 inches long (150cm wide and 200cm long).
        </p>
        <strong>Is a king-size bed bigger than a queen's?</strong>
        <p>
          A king-size divan base is wider than a queen-size one, but both king-
          and queen-size beds are the same length. A standard king size is 5
          feet wide and 6 feet and 6 inches long. Standard queen-sized beds,
          also known as small doubles, tend to be 4 feet wide. Check out our
          small double divan beds here and our double divan beds — which are
          bigger than a small double but smaller than a king-size bed.
        </p>
        <strong>Does a king-size bed make a difference?</strong>
        <p>
          Yes. King-size divan beds may only be three inches longer and six
          inches wider than a typical double bed — but believe us, those extra
          inches make a world of difference. If you are a lone sleeper, you
          probably don’t need a king-size bed. But if you sleep with a partner,
          you will definitely enjoy the extra space.
        </p>
        <strong>Will I sleep better in a king-size bed?</strong>
        <p>
          Yes. All other factors aside, couples are more likely to sleep better
          in a larger bed because there is more room for each person to
          stretch out and relax.
